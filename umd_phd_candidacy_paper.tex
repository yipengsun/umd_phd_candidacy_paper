\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the interactions
between elementary particles such as quarks and leptons.
The theory has been tested experimentally to a very high precision.
However, there are phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM, such as
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, hinting that there might be New Physics (NP) beyond the SM.
One way to search for NP is to measure the decay rates of certain processes
very precisely;
rates that differ from the SM predictions may provide evidence for NP.

Through experimental discovery, it has been established that leptons have three
flavors:
Charged leptons, namely electron $e$, muon $\mu$, and tau $\tau$;
their corresponding charge-neutral neutrinos: $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$.
SM assumes that all three flavors of leptons participate in all
interactions with the same strength, except for the Higgs mechanism through which
they acquire their mass.
This is known as lepton flavor universality (LFU).

LFU has been tested by different collaborations, including \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb.
Many precision measurements, such as the decay rate
of $K^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_e$ versus $K^- \rightarrow \mu^- \nu_\mu$\footnote{
    Unless specified, charge conjugation is assumed throughout the paper.
}, have been performed.
So far, no definite violation of LFU has been detected \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

This paper provides a review on recent measurements that challenge LFU.
Among which the semileptonic decay of $B$ mesons, such as
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} l^- \overline{\nu}_l$, is a more significant one.
The difference in decay rates in these measurements is typically characterized by \RDDst/,
defined as\footnote{
    $\mathcal{B}$ denotes branching fraction.
}:
\begin{equation}
    \RDDst/ \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau^- \overline{\nu}_\tau
        \right)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell
        \right)
    }
\end{equation}

Currently, the world average of the combined decay rate ratio \RDDst/
has a $3.08\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, pointing
to a possible lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV);
many collaborations are working on more precise measurements to provide a
definite answer.

In this paper, we begin with a theoretical review on why SM manifests LFU;
extensions to SM, such as 2-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), to permit LFUV;
and advantages of using semileptonic channels for this type of measurements.
We then review and compare colliders and detectors, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II
and LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), used in the testing of LFU.
After that, we will review current experimental results.
Finally, we provide an overlook on prospect for updating the \RDDst/ measurement with LHCb Run
2 data.

\section{Production and detection of $B$ mesons in different experiments}
$B$ mesons can be generated by two types of colliders:
$e^- e^+$ colliders, which are often referred as ``$B$ factories", and hadron colliders.
We will review $B$ production and detection in detail at \BaBar/ and LHCb, representing $B$ factory and hadron collider.
BELLE is another $B$ factory that share most features with \BaBar/, and its details will not be provided.

\section{Current measurements of \RDDst/}
In 2013, \BaBar/ reported a $3.4\sigma$ discrepancy in \RDDst/ from the
theoretical predictions \cite{Lees:2013rw}.
Since then, follow up measurements on the same semileptonic channel have been
performed by \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb, reporting various degrees of
discrepancies.
Currently, the world average of the measured \RDDst/ has a deviation of
$3.08\sigma$ with respect to SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, as shown
in \autoref{fig:rdrds_spring2019}.

% B-factory measurements
\subsection{Measurements at the $B$ factories} \label{sec:meas_bfactories}
As described in \autoref{sec:babar}, the $B$ factories
can estimate the momenta of the $B \overline{B}$ system precisely by tagging and reconstructing the other $B$, known as $B_{tag}$. By subtracting the momentum
of $B_{tag}$ to that of initial $e^+e^-$ system, the momentum of
the signal $B_{sig}$, which decays semileptonically and thus contains unreconstructed
neutrinos in the final state, can be inferred.

\BaBar/ and BELLE independently developed two types of tagging algorithms:
semileptonic tagging and hadronic tagging.
Semileptonic tagging finds $B_{tag}$ with the following decay:
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\ell$ is a $e$ or $\mu$.
This has the advantage of a larger branching ratio, thus more ($\approx 1\%$)
\Y4S/ events are tagged.
However, in this type of events, the $B_{tag}$ side has at least one missing neutrino, which
makes the reconstruction of $p_{B_{sig}}$ less precise \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

On the other hand, hadronic tagging searches over a very large number of
hadronic decay chains of $B$ for each \Y4S/ event, tagging the ones that match
one of the known modes.
This has a smaller tagging rate ($\approx 0.3\%$), but because $B_{tag}$ decays
hadronically, no missing neutrino is present in the tagged final product.
This makes the reconstructed momentum of $B_{sig}$ very
precise \cite{Lees:2013uzd,Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

All $B$ factory measurements choose a particular decay mode of the $\tau$:
$\tau^- \rightarrow \ell^- \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell$. In this way, the signal and
the normalization $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell$ decays
are reconstructed in the same final state, leading to the cancellation of
several sources of experimental uncertainty in the \RDDst/ ratios.

In 2013 \BaBar/ result,
Non-$B \overline{B}$ background and misreconstructed events are suppressed by
requiring a tag, together with the requirement of having a $D^{(*)}$ meson and a
charged lepton on $B_{sig}$ \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

The main background remaining is semileptonic $B$ decays to $D^{**}$, which has
similar $m^2_{miss}$ distribution to the signal.
The $D^{**}$ mode is reconstructed from $D^{(*)}\pi^0\ell$ control samples.
They can be differentiated after the fit from the signal by looking at the distribution of
$E^{*}_l$, the energy of the charged lepton in the $B$ rest
frame, because the background distribution extends to higher
energy \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

The signal and normalization yields are extracted from an extended, unbinned maximum-likelihood fit to two-dimensional $m^2_{miss}-|\vec{p}^*_\ell|$ distributions, with $D^{(*)}\ell$ and $D^{(*)}\pi^0\ell$ as inputs \cite{Lees:2013uzd}.
Note that the $|\vec{p}^*_\ell|$ can be readily converted to $E^*_\ell$.
The fit result is shown in \autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}.
The signal mode will have three neutrinos in the final product,
whereas the normalization mode only one.
By looking at the missing mass of the $B_{sig}$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
    m^2_{miss} \equiv \left(p_{B_{sig}} - p_{visible}\right)^2
\end{equation}
The signal, which has a non-zero $m^2_{miss}$, can be readily differentiated
from the normalization, which does have a $m^2_{miss} \approx 0$.
A Gaussian non-parametric kernel estimator is used in the
fitting process, for it allows for straightforward treading between variance
and bias \cite{Lees:2013uzd}, resulting in a better fit result.

% BELLE measurements
Other than the \BaBar/ result described above,
BELLE measured semileptonic $B$ decays with $\tau$ decays both
leptonically and hadronically.
Both semileptonic and hadronic tagging were used for the leptonic $\tau$ decay;
for hadronic $\tau$ decay, only hadronic tag was used.
The overall \RDDst/ deviation from the SM is about
$2\sigma$ \cite{Hirose:2017185}.

However, $B$ factories are limited by their data sample size, as discussed
in \autoref{sec:lhcb}.
This is the main advantage of LHCb.

% 2015 LHCb leptonic tau decay
\subsection{Measurements at LHCb} \label{sec:meas_lhcb}
The 2015 LHCb \RDst/ result, the first \RDst/ measurement at a hadron collider,
is $2.1\sigma$ larger than SM prediction \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
This analysis is heavily inspired by the preview $B$ factory measurements, with
a few caveats:
The $B \overline{B}$ rest frame is not known in a hadron collider;
a significant contribution to the background due to the following decay mode:
$B \rightarrow D^* H_c X$, as these decay modes have similar $m^2_{miss}$ and
$E^{*}_l$ distributions very similar to the signal \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh};
because the charge neutral particle resolution is not very good, a particular
decay mode, namely $\overline{B}^0 \rightarrow D^{*+} \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$, is
chosen so that all visible final state particles are charged.

Without the $B \overline{B}$ rest frame, tagging algorithms used in the $B$
factory measurements cannot be applied.
This problem is solved by \emph{rest frame approximation}, a technique developed
by the analysis:
Assuming $\vec{(p_{B})_T}$ is unchanged, approximate $(p_{B})_z$ by the
following:
\begin{equation}
    (p_{B})_z = \frac{m_B}{m_{reco}} (p_{reco})_z
\end{equation}
with $m_B$ the known $B$ mass.
This is shown to have sufficient resolution \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.

An extended, binned, maximum likelihood method is used in the fit, with three dimensional templates representing the signal, the normalization, and the background.
$m^2_{miss}$, $E^*_\mu$, and $q^2$ are the input variables to the fit.
The additional hadronic background is constrained by templates generated by
simulated data sample, with additional correction fitted from the
$D^{*+} \mu^- K^{\pm}$ control sample \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
From the fit results shown in \autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}, we see that backgrounds of $B$
factories and LHCb have very different composition.

\end{figure}

% 2018 LHCb hadronic tau decay: tau -> pi pi pi
Another LHCb result, the 2018 \RDst/ measurement, is in agreement with the SM \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
This analysis pioneered the usage of
$\tau^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \bar{\nu}_\tau$
and
$\tau^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^0 \bar{\nu}_\tau$
decay modes, leading to a more precise measurement \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
The main advantage, namely better signal-to-background ratio, will be discussed below.

By utilizing the $B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} 3\pi$ as the normalization, which has the same final state particles as that of the signal, experimental systematic uncertainties can be minimized.
The ratio between the two modes, defined as $\mathcal{K}(D^{*-}))$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{K}(D^{*-}) \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} \tau^+ \nu_\tau)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} 3 \pi)
    }
\end{equation}
can be converted back to \RDst/ with the appropriate branch fractions \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.

This analysis also took a different approach to separate signal from normalization:
With the decay mode $\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+$,
the $\tau$ decay vertex can be reconstructed from the three charged pions.
Due to the non-zero lifetime of $\tau$, its decay vertex is
separated from the $B$ meson decay vertex.
By requiring a clear separation between the two vertices, the prompt background
($D^* \pi \pi \pi X$), which have different topology than the signal, can be rejected.
The remaining double-charm background has the same topology as the signal.
A template derived from simulations is used to reject such
background \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
The topology of the signal, the prompt background, and the double-charm background are shown in \autoref{fig:lhcb_3pi_topo}, with the prompt-rejecting criteria ($\frac{\delta z}{\sigma_{\delta z}} > 4$ also shown.
