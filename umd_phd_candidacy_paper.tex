\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The Standard Model expects all leptons behave exactly the same, except in
    their couplings to the Higgs bosons, a feature called lepton flavor
    universality.
    However, measurements from \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb experiments showed
    tension with this expectation.
    This paper briefly reviews the theoretical foundations of lepton flavor
    universality, the recent results challenging it, and the prospect for a
    resolution.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the interactions
between elementary particles such as quarks and leptons.
The theory has been tested experimentally to a very high precision.
However, there are phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM, such as
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, hinting that there
might be New Physics (NP) beyond the SM.
One way to search for NP is to measure the decay rates of certain processes
very precisely;
rates that differ from the SM predictions may provide evidence for NP.

Through experimental discovery, it has been established that leptons have three
flavors:
Charged leptons, namely electron $e$, muon $\mu$, and tau $\tau$;
their corresponding charge-neutral neutrinos: $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$.
SM assumes that all three flavors of leptons participate in all
interactions with the same strength, except for the Higgs mechanism through
which they acquire their mass.
This is known as Lepton Flavor Universality (LFU).

LFU has been tested by different collaborations, including \BaBar/, BELLE, and
LHCb.
Many precision measurements, such as the decay rate
of $K \rightarrow e^- \bar{\nu}_e$ versus
$K \rightarrow \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu$\footnote{
    Unless specified, charge conjugation is assumed throughout the paper.
}, have been performed.
So far, no definite violation of LFU has been detected \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

This paper provides a review on recent measurements that challenge LFU.
Among which the semileptonic decay of $B$ mesons, such as
\BDDstMode{\ell}, is a more significant one, where the \DDst/ denotes a $D$
or \Dst/ meson.
The difference in decay rates in these measurements is typically characterized
by \RDDst/, defined as\footnote{
    $\mathcal{B}$ denotes branching fraction.
    $\ell$ stands for light leptons, namely an $e$ or a $\mu$, but not a $\tau$.
}:
\begin{equation}
    \RDDst/ \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}\left( \BDDstMode{\tau} \right)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}\left( \BDDstMode{\ell} \right)
    }
\end{equation}

Currently, the world average of the combined decay rate ratio \RDDst/
has a $3.08\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, pointing
to a possible lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV);
many collaborations are working on more precise measurements to provide a
definite answer.

In this paper, we begin with a theoretical review on why SM manifests LFU;
Higgs mechanism to show the couplings between different flavor of leptons and
Higgs bosons are different;
extensions to SM, such as 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), to permit LFUV;
We then review and compare colliders and detectors, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II
and LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), used in the testing of LFU.
After that, we will review current experimental results.
Finally, we provide an overlook on future measurement for a possible resolution
to current anomalies.

\section{Production and detection of $B$ mesons in different experiments}
$B$ mesons can be generated by two types of colliders:
$e^- e^+$ colliders, which are often referred as ``$B$ factories", and hadron
colliders.
We will review $B$ production and detection in detail at \BaBar/ and LHCb,
representing $B$ factory and hadron collider.
BELLE is another $B$ factory that shares most features with \BaBar/, and its
details will not be provided.

\section{Current measurements of \RDDst/}
In 2013, \BaBar/ reported a $3.4\sigma$ discrepancy in \RDDst/ from the
theoretical predictions \cite{Lees:2013rw}.
Since then, follow up measurements on the same semileptonic channel have been
performed by \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb, reporting various degrees of
discrepancies \cite{Hirose:2017185, LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803, Aaij:2017deq}.
The measured results are shown in \autoref{tab:results}.
Currently, the world average of the measured \RDDst/ has a deviation of
$3.08\sigma$ with respect to SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, as shown
in \autoref{fig:rdrds_spring2019}.

\section{Outlook}
The testing of LFU remains an outstanding problem in precision
physics.
More measurements are needed before any final conclusion can be drawn.
As seen in \autoref{tab:results}, the total uncertainties of $B$ factory
measurements are dominated by their statistical uncertainties.
In the hope to mitigate this problem, BELLE has recently upgraded their
facilities and aim to take a data sample with an integrated luminosity 50 times
larger than that of the previous $B$ factories \cite{Abe:2010gxa}.

In addition to the measurements from $B$ factories, it is crucial to have
independent validations from LHCb, an experiment that has very different sources
of systematic uncertainties.
It is expected that LHCb will publish their first combined \RD/ and \RDst/
measurements in the near future based on the \SI{8}{TeV} dataset
(\SI{3.2}{fb^{-1}}).
Additionally, an update of this measurement based on the \SI{13}{TeV} dataset
(\SI{6.0}{fb^{-1}}) has begun.
% Expected improvements
% Remember: Run 2 supposedly has better pile-ups.
% Current progress
The number of signal events is expected to increase significantly, thanks to
higher integrated luminosity, a larger $B \bar{B}$ production cross section, and
a new dedicated trigger.
An preliminary study shows that the gain might be as high as a factor of 5 per
fb$^{-1}$, as shown in \autoref{fig:lhcb_run2}.
%This is deemed optimistic, and more work is needed to validate the claim.

% Related measurements:
% R(J/Psi): B_c -> J/Psi l nu_l
% Lambda_b -> Lambda_c l nu_l
% These provides independent background
If NP exists and were to affect the \BDDstMode{\tau} decays, other $B$ decays
with the same $b \rightarrow c \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ transition should also be
impacted.
Examples include $B_c \rightarrow J/\Psi \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ and
$\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$.
Recent result \cite{Aaij:2017tyk} found tension in the former, and measurements
are in preparation for the latter.
Given all the upcoming measurements from the upgraded BELLE and LHCb, a
resolution to of present anomalies should be achievable in the next few years.
