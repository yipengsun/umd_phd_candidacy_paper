\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the interactions
between elementary particles such as quarks and leptons.
The theory has been tested experimentally to a very high precision.
However, there are phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM, such as
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, hinting that there might be New Physics (NP) beyond the SM.
One way to search for NP is to measure the decay rates of certain processes
very precisely;
rates that differ from the SM predictions may provide evidence for NP.

Through experimental discovery, it has been established that leptons have three
flavors:
Charged leptons, namely electron $e$, muon $\mu$, and tau $\tau$;
their corresponding charge-neutral neutrinos: $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$.
SM assumes that all three flavors of leptons participate in all
interactions with the same strength, except for the Higgs mechanism through which
they acquire their mass.
This is known as lepton flavor universality (LFU).

LFU has been tested by different collaborations, including \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb.
Many precision measurements, such as the decay rate
of $K^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_e$ versus $K^- \rightarrow \mu^- \nu_\mu$\footnote{
    Unless specified, charge conjugation is assumed throughout the paper.
}, have been performed.
So far, no definite violation of LFU has been detected \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

This paper provides a review on recent measurements that challenge LFU.
Among which the semileptonic decay of $B$ mesons, such as
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} l^- \overline{\nu}_l$, is a more significant one, where the $D^{(*)}$ denotes a $D$ or $D^*$ meson.
The difference in decay rates in these measurements is typically characterized by \RDDst/,
defined as\footnote{
    $\mathcal{B}$ denotes branching fraction.
    $\ell$ stands for light leptons, namely a $e$ or a $\mu$, but not a $\tau$.
}:
\begin{equation}
    \RDDst/ \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau^- \overline{\nu}_\tau
        \right)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell
        \right)
    }
\end{equation}

Currently, the world average of the combined decay rate ratio \RDDst/
has a $3.08\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, pointing
to a possible lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV);
many collaborations are working on more precise measurements to provide a
definite answer.

In this paper, we begin with a theoretical review on why SM manifests LFU;
extensions to SM, such as 2-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), to permit LFUV;
and advantages of using semileptonic channels for this type of measurements.
We then review and compare colliders and detectors, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II
and LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), used in the testing of LFU.
After that, we will review current experimental results.
Finally, we provide an overlook on prospect for updating the \RDDst/ measurement with LHCb Run
2 data.

$B$ mesons can be generated by two types of colliders:
$e^- e^+$ colliders, which are often referred as ``$B$ factories", and hadron colliders.
We will review $B$ production and detection in detail at \BaBar/ and LHCb, representing $B$ factory and hadron collider.
BELLE is another $B$ factory that share most features with \BaBar/, and its details will not be provided.

\section{Current measurements of \RDDst/}
In 2013, \BaBar/ reported a $3.4\sigma$ discrepancy in \RDDst/ from the
theoretical predictions \cite{Lees:2013rw}.
Since then, follow up measurements on the same semileptonic channel have been
performed by \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb, reporting various degrees of
discrepancies \cite{Hirose:2017185}, \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
Currently, the world average of the measured \RDDst/ has a deviation of
$3.08\sigma$ with respect to SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, as shown
in \autoref{fig:rdrds_spring2019}.

% B-factory measurements
\subsection{Measurements at the $B$ factories} \label{sec:meas_bfactories}
The $B$ factories reconstruct $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau^- \overline{\nu}_\tau$ (signal) and $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell$ (normalization) decays by selecting events with a tagged $B$ meson ($B_{tag}$), a $D^{(*)}$ meson, and an $e$ or $\mu$.
As described in \autoref{sec:babar}, the $B$ factories
can estimate the momenta of the $B \overline{B}$ system precisely by tagging and reconstructing the other $B$, known as $B_{tag}$. By subtracting the momentum
of $B_{tag}$ to that of initial $e^+e^-$ system, the momentum of
the signal $B_{sig}$, which decays semileptonically and thus contains unreconstructed
neutrinos in the final state, can be inferred.

\BaBar/ and BELLE independently developed two types of tagging algorithms:
semileptonic tagging and hadronic tagging.
Semileptonic tagging finds $B_{tag}$ with the following decay:
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$, where $\ell$ is a $e$ or $\mu$.
This has the advantage of a larger branching ratio, thus more ($\approx 1\%$)
\Y4S/ events are tagged.
However, in this type of events, the $B_{tag}$ side has at least one missing neutrino, which
makes the reconstruction of $p_{B_{sig}}$ less precise \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

On the other hand, hadronic tagging searches over a very large number of
hadronic decay chains of $B$ for each \Y4S/ event, tagging the ones that match
one of the known modes.
This has a smaller tagging rate ($\approx 0.3\%$), but because $B_{tag}$ decays
hadronically, no missing neutrino is present in the tagged final product.
This makes the reconstructed momentum of $B_{sig}$ very
precise \cite{Lees:2013uzd,Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

$D^{0}$ and $D^{+}$ mesons are reconstructed in numerous final states, including final states with neutral particles.
$D^{*0}$ and $D^{*+}$ mesons are reconstructed by associating soft pions or photons with previously reconstructed $D$ mesons.

All $B$ factory measurements choose a particular decay mode of the $\tau$:
$\tau^- \rightarrow \ell^- \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_\ell$. In this way, the signal and
the normalization $B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell$ decays
are reconstructed in the same final state, leading to the cancellation of
several sources of experimental uncertainty in the \RDDst/ ratios.
While both signal and normalization events have the same visible particles in the final state,
the signal mode has three neutrinos in the final product,
whereas the normalization mode has only one.
By looking at the missing mass of the $B_{sig}$, defined as
\begin{equation}
    m^2_{miss} \equiv \left(p_{B_{sig}} - p_{visible}\right)^2,
\end{equation}
the signal, which has a non-zero $m^2_{miss}$, can be readily differentiated
from the normalization, which does have a $m^2_{miss} \approx 0$.

Non-$B \overline{B}$ background and misreconstructed events are suppressed by
rejecting events with tracks that are not used in the reconstruction of the $B_{tag}$, $D^{(*)}$, or lepton \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

The main background remaining is due to semileptonic $B \rightarrow D^{**} \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays.
$D^{**}$ decays into a $D^{*}$ and a number of soft pions, which are often not reconstructed.
As a result, the $m^2_{miss}$ distribution is similar to that of the signal.
This background is constrained by constructing $D^{(*)}\pi^0\ell$ control samples with the same selection as the signal samples plus an additional $\pi^0$.
In these control samples, $D^{**}$ mesons that decay to $D^{(*)} \pi^0$ are fully reconstructed, leading to an easily distinguishable peak in the $m^2_{miss}$ distribution \cite{Lees:2013uzd}.

The signal and normalization yields are extracted from maximum-likelihood fits, which rely primarily on  
the $m^2_{miss}$ and $|\vec{p}^*_\ell|$ distributions.
The fit result is shown in \autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}.
The probability distribution functions for all contributions are taken from Monte-Carlo simulated samples, with corrections coming from data control samples.

As can be seen in \autoref{tab:results}, all four $B$ factory results are limited by the size of their data samples. 

% 2015 LHCb leptonic tau decay
\subsection{Measurements at LHCb} \label{sec:meas_lhcb}
LHCb has published two measurements of \RDST/; one measurement from 2015 where the $\tau$ is reconstructed leptonically in the $\tau^- \rightarrow \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \nu_\tau$ decay mode,
and another from 2018 where the $\tau$ is reconstructed in the $\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^- \nu_\tau$ decay.

The 2015 result constituted the first \RDst/ measurement in the very challenging environment of a hadron collider.
This analysis is heavily inspired by the previous $B$ factory measurements, with
a few key differences:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The $B \overline{B}$ rest frame is unknown.
    \item Larger backgrounds, especially a significant contribution due to the following decay mode:
          $B \rightarrow D^* H_c X$, where $H_c$ is any charm meson, and $X$ is any hadronic particle. 
          These decay modes have similar $m^2_{miss}$ and
          $E^{*}_l$ distributions very similar to the signal
    \item A particular
          decay mode of the $B$ and $D^{*}$ are chosen so that all visible final state particles are charged due to the fact that the neutral particle resolution is not very good
\end{itemize}

Without the $B \overline{B}$ rest frame, the tagging algorithms used in the $B$
factory measurements cannot be applied.
This problem is solved by the so-called \emph{rest frame approximation}, a technique developed
specifically for this analysis.
This approximation assumes the momentum of the $B$ that is orthogonal to the beam axis, transverse momentum, is unchanged.
The component of the $B$ momentum parallel to the beam axis, $(p_{B})_z$, is approximated as
\begin{equation}
    (p_{B})_z = \frac{m_B}{m_{reco}} (p_{reco})_z,
\end{equation}
with $m_B$ being the known $B$ mass, and $reco$ referring to the $D^{*+} \mu^-$ system.
The resulting $m^2_{miss}$ resolution is worse than that of the $B$ factories, but is sufficient to preserve the discriminating power between the signal and normalization, as shown in \autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}.

A multivariate method is employed to determine which tracks are likely to have originated from the $B_{sig}$ decay.
Events that contain tracks that are unassociated with the $D^{*+}$ or the $\mu^-$ are rejected, reducing the $B \rightarrow D^* H_c X$ and other backgrounds.
By inverting the isolation selecting criteria, control samples are obtained to correct for the shape of these background distributions.

An extended, binned, maximum likelihood method is used in the fit, with three dimensional templates in the $m^2_{miss}$, $E^*_\mu$, and $q^2$ variables describing the contributions from signal, normalization, and background events.
\autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison} (g, h, i) show the fit results. 
We see that this LHCb result has a lower signal-to-background ratio, but significantly higher number of signal events.

\end{figure}

% 2018 LHCb hadronic tau decay: tau -> pi pi pi
The 2018 LHCb \RDst/ measurement pioneered the usage of
$\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^- \nu_\tau$
decay modes in $B \rightarrow D^{*} \tau \nu_\tau$.

Since the $tau$ lepton is reconstructed with the $\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^- \pi^+ \pi^- \nu_\tau$ modes, the final state particles of signal events are different from those of normalization events.
Instead, to cancel experimental systematic uncertainties, this analysis employs the $B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} 3\pi$ as the normalization, which has the same final state particles as that of the signal.
This analysis measures the ratio, defined as $\mathcal{K}(D^{*-}))$
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{K}(D^{*-}) \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} \tau^+ \nu_\tau)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} 3 \pi)
    },
\end{equation}
which can be converted back to \RDst/ with the appropriate branching fractions.

This analysis took a different approach to separate signal from normalization events:
With the decay mode $\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+ \nu_\tau$,
the $\tau$ decay vertex can be reconstructed from the intersection of the three charged pion tracks.
Due to the non-zero lifetime of the $\tau$, its decay vertex is
separated from the $B$ meson decay vertex.
In contrast, the three pions from the $B \rightarrow D^* \pi \pi \pi X$ normalization (prompt) mode come directly from the $B$ decay vertex.
By requiring a clear separation between the two vertices, the normalization mode can be effectively separated from signal events, as \autoref{fig:lhcb_3pi_topo} shows.
The main background is composed of $B \rightarrow D^* D X$ double-charm events, which is suppressed by a specifically-designed multivariate method.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.65\textwidth]{figs/lhcb_3pi_topo.pdf}

        Topology of the signal, the prompt, and the double-charmed background \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
    }
    \label{fig:lhcb_3pi_topo}
\end{figure}

This measurement, which uses the hadronic $\tau$ decays, results in a significantly reduced statistical uncertainty compared to the 2015 LHCb result. However the total uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects.
