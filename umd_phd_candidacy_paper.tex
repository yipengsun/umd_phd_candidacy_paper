\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the interactions
between elementary particles such as quarks and leptons.
The theory has been tested experimentally to a very high precision.
However, there are phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM, such as
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, hinting that there might be New Physics (NP) beyond the SM.
One way to search for NP is to measure the decay rates of certain processes
very precisely;
rates that differ from the SM predictions may provide evidence for NP.

Through experimental discovery, it has been established that leptons have three
flavors:
Charged leptons, namely electron $e$, muon $\mu$, and tau $\tau$;
their corresponding charge-neutral neutrinos: $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$.
SM assumes that all three flavors of leptons participate in all
interactions with the same strength, except for the Higgs mechanism through which
they acquire their mass.
This is known as lepton flavor universality (LFU).

LFU has been tested in many precision measurements, such as the decay rate
of $K^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_e$ versus $K^- \rightarrow \mu^- \nu_\mu$\footnote{
    Unless specified, charge conjugation is assumed throughout the paper.
}.
So far, no definite violation of LFU has been detected.

In this paper, we focus on the semileptonic decays of $B$ mesons, such as
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} l^- \overline{\nu}_l$:
Currently, the world average of the combined decay rate ratio $\RDDst/$,
defined as\footnote{
    $\mathcal{B}$ denotes branching fraction.
}:
\begin{equation}
    \RDDst/ \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B^{0,-} \rightarrow D^{+,0(*)} \tau^- \overline{\nu}_\tau
        \right)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B^{0,-} \rightarrow D^{+,0(*)} \mu^- \overline{\nu}_\mu
        \right)
    }
\end{equation}
has a $3.08\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, pointing
to a possible lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV);
many collaborations are working on more precise measurements to provide a
definite answer.

In this paper, we begin with a theoretical review on
why SM manifests LFU;
extensions to SM, such as 2-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), to permit LFUV;
and advantages of using semileptonic channels for this type of measurements.
We then review and compare colliders and detectors, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II
and LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), used in the testing of LFU.
After that, we will review current experimental results.
Finally, we provide an overlook on prospect for updating the $\RDDst/$ measurement with LHCb Run
2 data.

\section{Review of previous measurements of \RDDst/}
In 2013, \BaBar/ reported a $3.4\sigma$ discrepancy in \RDDst/ from the
theoretical predictions \cite{Lees:2013rw}.
Since then, follow up measurements on the same semileptonic channel have been
performed by \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb, reporting various degrees of
discrepancies.
Currently, the world average of the measured \RDDst/ has a deviation of
$3.08\sigma$ with respect to SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, as shown
in \autoref{fig:rdrds_spring2019}.

% B-factory measurements
As mentioned in \autoref{sec:babar}, $B$ factories, such as \BaBar/ and BELLE,
know the momenta of the $B \overline{B}$ system exactly.
By tagging and reconstructing the other $B$, known as $B_{tag}$, the momentum of
the signal $B_{sig}$, which decays semileptonically, can be inferred.

\BaBar/ and BELLE independently developed two types of tagging algorithms:
semileptonic tagging and hadronic tagging.
Semileptonic tagging finds $B_{tag}$ with the following decay:
$B^- \rightarrow l^- \bar{\nu}_l$, where $l$ is a $e$ or $\mu$.
This has the advantage of a larger branching ratio, thus more ($\approx 1\%$)
\Y4S/ events are tagged.
However, in this type of events, at least two neutrinos are presents, which
makes the reconstruction of $p_{B_{sig}}$ less precise \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

On the other hand, hadronic tagging searches over a very large number of
hadronic decay chains of $B$ for each \Y4S/ event, tagging the ones that match
one of the known modes.
This has a smaller tagging rate ($\approx 0.3$), but because $B_{tag}$ decays
hadronically, no neutrino is present in the final product.
This makes the reconstructed momentum of $B_{sig}$ very
precise \cite{Lees:2013uzd,Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

$B$ factory analyses also choose a particular decay mode of $\tau$:
$\tau^- \rightarrow l^- \nu_\tau \bar{\nu}_l$.
Thus the signal mode will have three neutrinos in the final product,
whereas the normalization mode only one.
By looking at the missing mass of the $B_{sig}$, defined as:
\begin{equation}
    m^2_{miss} \equiv \left(p_{B_{sig}} - p_{visible}\right)^2
\end{equation}
The signal, which has a non-zero $m^2_{miss}$, can be readily differentiated
from the normalization, which does have a $m^2_{miss} \approx 0$.

Non-$B \overline{B}$ background and misreconstructed events are suppressed by
requiring a tag, together with the requirement of having a $D^{(*)}$ meson and a
charged lepton on $B_{sig}$ \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

The main background remaining is semileptonic $B$ decays to $D^{**}$, which has
similar $m^2_{miss}$ distribution to the signal.
They can be differentiated from the signal by looking at the distribution of
$E^{*}_l$, the energy of the charged lepton in the $B$ rest
frame, because the background distribution extends to higher
energy \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

The 2013 \BaBar/ result used a Gaussian non-parametric kernel estimator in the
fitting process, because it allows for straightforward treading between variance
and bias \cite{Lees:2013uzd}, resulting in a better fit result.

% BELLE measurements
Other than the \BaBar/ result mentioned at the beginning of this section,
BELLE measured semileptonic $B$ decays with $\tau$ decays both
leptonically and hadronically.
Both semileptonic and hadronic tagging were used for the leptonic $\tau$ decay;
for hadronic $\tau$ decay, only hadronic tag was used.
The overall \RDDst/ deviation from the SM is about
$2\sigma$ \cite{Hirose:2017185}.

However, $B$ factories are limited by their data sample size, as discussed
in \autoref{sec:lhcb}.
This is the main advantage of LHCb.

% 2015 LHCb leptonic tau decay
The 2015 LHCb \RDst/ result, the first \RDst/ measurement at a hadron collider,
is $2.1\sigma$ larger than SM prediction \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
This analysis is heavily inspired by the preview $B$ factory measurements, with
a few caveats:
The $B \overline{B}$ rest frame is not known in a hadron collider;
a significant contribution to the background due to the following decay mode:
$B \rightarrow D^* H_c X$, as these decay modes have similar $m^2_{miss}$ and
$E^{*}_l$ distributions very similar to the signal \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh};
because the charge neutral particle resolution is not very good, a particular
decay mode, namely $\overline{B}^0 \rightarrow D^{*+} \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$, is
chosen so that all visible final state particles are charged.

Without the $B \overline{B}$ rest frame, tagging algorithms used in the $B$
factory measurements cannot be applied.
This problem is solved by \emph{rest frame approximation}, a technique developed
by the analysis:
Assuming $\vec{(p_{B})_T}$ is unchanged, approximate $(p_{B})_z$ by the
following:
\begin{equation}
    (p_{B})_z = \frac{m_B}{m_{reco}} (p_{reco})_z
\end{equation}
with $m_B$ the known $B$ mass.
This is shown to have sufficient resolution \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.

The additional hadronic background is constrained by templates generated by
simulated data sample, with additional correction fitted from the
$D^{*+} \mu^- K^{\pm}$ control sample \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
From \autoref{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}, we see that backgrounds of $B$
factories and LHCb have very different composition.

    \label{fig:babar_lhcb_fit_comparison}
\end{figure}

% 2018 LHCb hadronic tau decay: tau -> pi pi pi
The 2018 LHCb \RDst/ result is in agreement with the SM \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
It used a different definition of \RDst/, renaming to $\mathcal{K}(D^{*-}))$:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{K}(D^{*-})) \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} \tau^+ \nu_\tau)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}(B^0 \rightarrow D^{*-} 3 \pi)
    }
\end{equation}

It also took a different approach to separate signal from normalization:
By using a different $t$ decay mode $\tau^- \rightarrow \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^+$,
the $\tau$ decay vertex can be reconstructed from the three charged pions.
Since $\tau$ flies a certain distance before it decays, its decay vertex is
separated from its generation vertex.
Thus, the signal events have a different topology than the normalization, of
which all final state particles point to the same vertex \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.

By requiring a clear separation between the two vertices, the prompt background
($D^* \pi \pi \pi X$) can be rejected.
The remaining double-charm background has the same topology as the signal.
A template derived from simulations is used to reject such
background \cite{Aaij:2017deq}.
