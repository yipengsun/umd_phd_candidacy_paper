\maketitle

\section{Introduction}
What is LFUV? (FU physics, FUV physics)
Why semileptonic decays (good thing about form factor)?
A historical review, starting from 2012 BaBar;
Talk about Phoebe's run 1 analyses.
Talk about what we are doing.
Talk about expected improvements and drawbacks of our upcoming analysis compared
to run 1.

\section{Theory}
\subsection{Lepton flavor universality}

\subsection{Advantages of semileptonic channel decays}

\subsection{Higgs mechanism}

\subsection{2-Higgs doublet models (2HDM)}
% type-II model claimed to be excluded; type-III (very similar to type-II) still
% alive.

\subsection{Leptoquark models}


\section{Review of colliders/detectors for $B$-physics}
One may ask: Why are we so interested in $B$ mesons?
% Initially B factories are meant for CP violation detection.
Initially, B factories, such as \BaBar/, was primarily constructed to do
precision measurements on CP violation of \cite{Luth:1994}.


% Talk about why B-bound states/mesons are also good for testing LFUV.
$B$ mesons provide a good testing bed for new physics:
They have enough energy to decay into all 3 flavors of leptons;
at the same time, they are not too heavy to produce.

All measurements start from $b\bar{b}$ bound states.
Electron-position colliders\footnote{
    Such as PEP-II, the collider for the \BaBar/ experiment.
} produce $\Upsilon_{4s}$ via electroweak interaction
Hadron colliders\footnote{
    Such as Large Hadron Collider (LHC) for the LHCb experiment.
} produce $\Upsilon_{4s}$ via strong interaction.
