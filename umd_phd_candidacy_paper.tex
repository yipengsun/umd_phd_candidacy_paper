\section{Introduction}
The Standard Model (SM) has been very successful in describing the interactions
between elementary particles such as quarks and leptons.
The theory has been tested experimentally to a very high precision.
However, there are phenomena that cannot be explained by the SM, such as
the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe, hinting that there might be New Physics (NP) beyond the SM.
One way to search for NP is to measure the decay rates of certain processes
very precisely;
rates that differ from the SM predictions may provide evidence for NP.

Through experimental discovery, it has been established that leptons have three
flavors:
Charged leptons, namely electron $e$, muon $\mu$, and tau $\tau$;
their corresponding charge-neutral neutrinos: $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$ and $\nu_\tau$.
SM assumes that all three flavors of leptons participate in all
interactions with the same strength, except for the Higgs mechanism through which
they acquire their mass.
This is known as lepton flavor universality (LFU).

LFU has been tested by different collaborations, including \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb.
Many precision measurements, such as the decay rate
of $K^- \rightarrow e^- \nu_e$ versus $K^- \rightarrow \mu^- \nu_\mu$\footnote{
    Unless specified, charge conjugation is assumed throughout the paper.
}, have been performed.
So far, no definite violation of LFU has been detected \cite{Ciezarek:2017yzh}.

This paper provides a review on recent measurements that challenge LFU.
Among which the semileptonic decay of $B$ mesons, such as
$B^- \rightarrow D^{(*)} l^- \overline{\nu}_l$, is a more significant one, where the $D^{(*)}$ denotes a $D$ or $D^*$ meson.
The difference in decay rates in these measurements is typically characterized by \RDDst/,
defined as\footnote{
    $\mathcal{B}$ denotes branching fraction.
    $\ell$ stands for light leptons, namely a $e$ or a $\mu$, but not a $\tau$.
}:
\begin{equation}
    \RDDst/ \equiv \frac{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \tau^- \overline{\nu}_\tau
        \right)
    }{
        \mathcal{B}\left(
            B \rightarrow D^{(*)} \ell^- \overline{\nu}_\ell
        \right)
    }
\end{equation}

Currently, the world average of the combined decay rate ratio \RDDst/
has a $3.08\sigma$ deviation from the SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, pointing
to a possible lepton flavor universality violation (LFUV);
many collaborations are working on more precise measurements to provide a
definite answer.

In this paper, we begin with a theoretical review on why SM manifests LFU;
extensions to SM, such as 2-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), to permit LFUV;
and advantages of using semileptonic channels for this type of measurements.
We then review and compare colliders and detectors, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II
and LHCb at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), used in the testing of LFU.
After that, we will review current experimental results.
Finally, we provide an overlook on prospect for updating the \RDDst/ measurement with LHCb Run
2 data.

\section{Production and detection of $B$ mesons in different experiments}
$B$ mesons can be generated by two types of colliders:
$e^- e^+$ colliders, which are often referred as ``$B$ factories", and hadron colliders.
We will review $B$ production and detection in detail at \BaBar/ and LHCb, representing $B$ factory and hadron collider.
BELLE is another $B$ factory that share most features with \BaBar/, and its details will not be provided.

\section{Current measurements of \RDDst/}
In 2013, \BaBar/ reported a $3.4\sigma$ discrepancy in \RDDst/ from the
theoretical predictions \cite{Lees:2013rw}.
Since then, follow up measurements on the same semileptonic channel have been
performed by \BaBar/, BELLE, and LHCb, reporting various degrees of
discrepancies \cite{Hirose:2017185, LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803, Aaij:2017deq}.
The measured results are shown in \autoref{tab:results}.
Currently, the world average of the measured \RDDst/ has a deviation of
$3.08\sigma$ with respect to SM prediction \cite{HFLAV:2019}, as shown
in \autoref{fig:rdrds_spring2019}.
