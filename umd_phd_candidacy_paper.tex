\section{Review for detectors/colliders used in testing LFU}
The LFU has been tested in many precision measurements.
The majority of them involve the difference between the decay rates of $B$
mesons to $\tau$ and $\mu$.

% Why not J/psi (c cbar, mass ~ 3.10 GeV, mass of tau ~ 1.77 GeV)?
One may ask: Why are we so focused on $b$ quark bound states and mesons?
After all, $J/\psi$, a $c\bar{c}$ bound state, is already kinematically allowed
to decay into all three generations of leptons.
The main reason is:
% Initially B factories are meant for CP violation detection.
Initially, detectors of $B$ factories, such as \BaBar/ at PEP-II, were
primarily constructed to for precision measurements on CP violation of $B^0$,
for SM predicts ``large, calculable'' CP violation in the decay of these mesons
\cite{Luth:1994}.
But these detectors proved to be advantageous in the testing of LFU:
These measurements have very similar requirements on the
detector \cite{Boutigny:1995ib}.
Thus, testing of LFU is often part of the secondary goals of these
experiments \cite{Luth:1994}.

In this section, I will review \BaBar/ detector at the PEP-II collider, and LHCb
at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)---both have conducted various tests on LFU.
These detectors/colliders are representative of the detectors for
electron-position colliders and hadron colliders.
