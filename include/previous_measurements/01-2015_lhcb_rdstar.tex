\subsection{2015 LHCb \RDst/}
The 2015 LHCb \RDst/ paper reports
$\RDst = 0.336 \pm 0.027 \text{(stat)} \pm 0.030 \text{(syst)}$, which is
$2.1 \sigma$ larger than the SM prediction \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.

One interesting choice of this analysis is that it concerns only one
semileptonic decay mode:
$\overline{B}^0 \longrightarrow D^{*+} l^- \overline{\nu}_l$.
Because all the final products, except for $\overline{\nu}_l$, are charged,
making reconstruction easier for LHCb \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.

Since the center of mass energy is unknown in hadron colliders, previous tagging
algorithms for $e^- e^+$ detectors cannot be used.
To estimate $p_{B}$, a new rest frame approximation method is developed:
Assuming $\vec{(p_{B})_T}$ is unchanged, approximate $(p_{B})_z$ by the
following:
\begin{equation*}
    (p_{B})_z = \frac{m_B}{m_{reco}} (p_{reco})_z
\end{equation*}
with $m_B$ the known $B$ mass.
This is shown to have sufficient resolution \cite{LHCb:PhysRevLett.115.111803}.
