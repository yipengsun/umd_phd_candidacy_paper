SM assumes that there is only one Higgs-doublet $\Phi$; however, leptons have
three flavor families.
Inspired by the multi-flavor nature of the leptons, theorists proposed many two
Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) that may violate LFU \cite{Branco:2011iw}.
All 2HDM predict the existence of a charged Higgs $H^{\pm}$, which can have
sizable indirect effects in $B$ physics \cite{Branco:2011iw}.

The 2013 \BaBar/ paper excluded type-II 2HDM, a minimal extension to the SM, at
95\% confidence level \cite{Lees:2013uzd}.
More complex 2HDM, which induces increasingly deviating predictions from SM, is
still not fully excluded.

Another popular extension to the SM is the leptoquark model, which enables
direct interaction between a quark and a lepton.
This model also permits LFUV \cite{Faber:2018afz}.
