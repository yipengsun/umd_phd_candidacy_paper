SM assumes that there is only one Higgs-doublet $\Phi$; however, leptons have
three flavor families.
Inspired by the multi-flavor nature of the leptons, theorists proposed many
2HDMs that may violate LFU \cite{Branco:2011iw}.
All 2HDMs predict the existence of a charged Higgs $H^{\pm}$, which can have
sizable indirect effects in $B$ physics.

% alive.
% Leptoquark is currently the more popular model
The 2013 \BaBar/ paper excluded type-II 2HDM, a minimal extension to the SM, at
95\% confidence level \cite{Lees:2013uzd}.
More complex 2HDMs, which induces increasingly deviating predictions from SM, are
still not fully excluded.

Another popular extension to the SM that enables LFUV is the leptoquark model.
This model enables direct interaction between a quark and a
lepton \cite{Faber:2018afz}.
