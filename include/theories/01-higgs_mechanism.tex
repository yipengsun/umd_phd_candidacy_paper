However, \autoref{sec:lfu} is only an incomplete picture:
Leptons acquire their mass through their interaction with the Higgs bosons,
but different flavor of leptons have different mass, this implies lepton-Higgs
coupling varies with flavor.

The electroweak Lagrangian is locally invariant under $SU(2)$ transformations;
this symmetry needs to be preserved.
Naive Mass term of the form $\overline{\Psi} m \Psi$
spoils $SU(2)$ symmetry of the Lagrangian, hence it is not permitted.
Instead, we add a doublet scalar field $\Phi$, known as Higgs doublet,
interacting on both gauge bosons and fermions.
After spontaneous symmetry breaking of the vacuum state, the Lagrangian
preserves its symmetry, and the new terms in the Lagrangian, encapsulated in
\Lden{yuk}, are interpreted as mass terms.

We inspect the coupling in the mass terms for the
leptons \cite{Langacker:2010zza}\footnote{
    The notation has been simplified.
}
\begin{equation}
    m_l \equiv \Gamma_l \frac{\nu}{\sqrt{2}},
\end{equation}
with $\nu$ interpreted as vacuum expectation value of $\Phi$, and $\Gamma_l$ the
coupling between lepton with flavor $\ell$ and Higgs.
This shows that leptons coupling stronger to the $\Phi$ (Higgs) field will be
more massive.

The Higgs mechanism completes the picture:
Now we see that SM demands LFU, except for the Higgs coupling.
