Leptons participate in electroweak interaction only,
which can be described by a Lagrangian of the following form:
$\Lden{ew} = \Lden{gauge} + \Lden{f} + \Lden{\phi} + \Lden{Yuk}$.

In SM, leptons require a gauge boson to interact with other particles.
Before leptons acquire their mass, all of their interactions are described by
the fermionic part of the Lagrangian \Lden{f}, which
reads \cite{Langacker:2010zza}
\begin{align}
    \Lden{f} = \sum_{l = 1}^F \Big(
        & \bar{\spin{q}}^0_{lL} i \fsl{D} \spin{q}^0_{lL} +
          \bar{\spin{l}}^0_{lL} i \fsl{D} \spin{l}^0_{lL} + \nonumber \\
        & \bar{u}^0_{lR} i \fsl{D} u^0_{lR} +
          \bar{d}^0_{lR} i \fsl{D} d^0_{lR} +
          \bar{e}^0_{lR} i \fsl{D} e^0_{lR} +
          \bar{\nu}^0_{lR} i \fsl{D} \nu^0_{lR}
    \Big),
\end{align}
where the number $F$, empirically 3, of fermion flavors is summed over, and
$L,R$ denote $SU(2)_L$ doublet and singlet in each flavor generation.
The SM $SU(2)_L$ lepton field is denoted by $\spin{l}^0_{lL}$\footnote{
    The left-handed lepton doublet is defined as:
    $\spin{l}^0_{lL} = \begin{pmatrix} \nu_l \\ l \end{pmatrix}$,
    where $l$ denotes lepton flavor.
}.

From the Lagrangian we see that the interactions between fermions and gauge
bosons (the interactions are embedded in the \fsl{D} covariant derivative) are
independent of their flavor.
This is known as LFU.
