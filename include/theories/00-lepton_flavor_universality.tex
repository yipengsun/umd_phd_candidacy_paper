Leptons participate in electroweak interaction only;
the interaction can be described by a Lagrangian.
%The electroweak Lagrangian is locally invariant under the transformations in
%$SU(2)_L \otimes U(1)$ group.
The fermion part of the Lagrangian reads \cite{Langacker:2010zza}:
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{L}_f = \sum_{m = 1}^F \left(
        \bar{q}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} q^0_{mL} +
        \bar{l}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} l^0_{mL} +
        \bar{u}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} u^0_{mL} +
        \bar{d}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} d^0_{mL} +
        \bar{e}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} e^0_{mL} +
        \bar{\nu}^0_{mL} i \fsl{D} \nu^0_{mL}
    \right)
\end{equation*}
where the number $F$, empirically 3, of fermion family is summed over.
From the Lagrangian we see that the interaction is independent of fermion
family, thus SM demands LFU.
